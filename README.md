# LL Theme

A default theme for LeisureLink web properties.

This package may also serve as a template for creating new themes and for documenting the theme API all LeisureLink web properties will use.

## Requirements

LeisureLink themes use [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables). It is expected that theme files are intended to be used in an environment that supports the full set of CSS custom properties including the proposed [@apply rule](https://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-apply-rule/) or with a build time tool that provides polyfills or transformations such as [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).
